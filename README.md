# Academic Paper in Markdown
Some ideas for those looking to start writing academica abstracts in RMarkdown.


I was interested in writing a paper in markdown. This was because I was tired of word, wanted to be able to use git for versioning, wanted a nice presentation format, and wanted better control over my references, all without using \LaTeX (though im not oppose to \LaTeX ).

Ive included some examples of forms you can use for yourself both without anything extra and with YAML alterations that need a .lua file.

Ill work on this as I learn more. Im really new at this so if there are changes that can improve these please let me know.



...more to come.
