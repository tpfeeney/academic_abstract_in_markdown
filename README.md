# Academic Paper in Markdown
Some ideas for those looking to start writing academica abstracts in RMarkdown.


I was interested in writing a paper in markdown. This was because I was tired of word, wanted to be able to use git for versioning, wanted a nice presentation format, and wanted better control over my references, all without using \LaTeX (though im not oppose to \LaTeX ).

Ive included some examples of forms you can use for yourself both without anything extra and with YAML alterations that need a .lua file.

Ill work on this as I learn more. Im really new at this so if there are changes that can improve these please let me know.


Things Ive Included:

Tables in landscape two ways, both included after the references

In text figures and figures after the reference section


Things im still learning how to do

Include in text DAG or DAG at the end of a document; will likely require me learning TikzDevice

Learning how to get a table to insert correctly in text with two column format

Figure out how to get the tables to render appropriately when knitted to word-the tables currently only work when knitted to PDF

...more to come.
